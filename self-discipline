#stay away from temptations if you aren't self-discipline enough#

With the highly developed internet environment,everyone is able to get access to  
various amusements such as short videos,soap operas,computer games and so on.  
On the one hand,theses things can provide us with temporary pleasure and relaxation,  
one the other hand,they waste us plenty of time which is priceless and finite.  

It often happened to me that 2 or 3 hours passed by without consciousness when I watched short videos or played  
games on my mobile phone.And I felt guilty for the time I killed which could be used to study.
